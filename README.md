# Applied Numerical Analysis
## ME 2020
Implements some numerical techniques in C/C++, Python, MATLAB, and FORTRAN.

## Compiling C/C++ and FORTRAN Codes
Use a C++ compiler that supports the modules feature (since c++20) and a
FORTRAN compiler that supports the 2008 standard. I recommend using the
latest stable version of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) since it's the
compiler I use for building all my projects.

If you choose another compiler (from LLVM, Intel, etc.) feel free to
report any compilation issues. (Assuming the selected compiler version
supports the mentioned features.)

## Python
The supplied codes use Python 3 features (such as f-strings),
they won't execute successfully if you use Python 2.
I recommend using the Spyder 3 IDE because it provides a graphical
user-interface GUI similar to that of MATLAB.

## MATLAB
Use the latest available version at your disposal.

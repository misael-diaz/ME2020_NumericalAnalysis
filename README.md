# ME2020_NumericalAnalysis
Implements some numerical techniques in C/C++, Python, MATLAB, and FORTRAN.

# Compiling C/C++ and FORTRAN Codes
Use a C++ compiler that supports the modules feature (since c++20) and a FORTRAN compiler that supports 
the 2008 standard. I recommend using the latest stable version of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) since 
it's the compiler I use for building all my projects. 

If you choose another compiler (from LLVM, Intel, etc.) feel free to report any compilation issues.

# Python
The codes use Python 3 features (such as the f-strings), they won't execute successfully if you use Python 2.
I recommend using the Spyder 3 IDE because it provides a graphical user-interface similar to that of MATLAB.

# MATLAB
Use the latest available version at your disposal.
